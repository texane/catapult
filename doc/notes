. computing the spring constant from geometry and material information
 . from here(http://www.engineersedge.com/spring_comp_calc_k.htm) the spring constant is given by:
  . k = (G * (d^4)) / (8 * D^3 * Na) * 10^6 where
   . k the spring constant, in N.m^-1
   . G the material shear modulus, in GPa
   . d the wire diameter, in mm
   . D the spring nominal coil diameter, in mm
   . Na the number of active coils turn count

 . the shear modulus is related to the young modulus by the formula
  . E = 2 * G * (1 + V) where
   . E the young modulus, in GPa
   . G the shear modulus, in GPa
   . V the poisson ratio
  . for the Zinc material
   . E = 78
   . G = 29.3
   . V = 0.331

 . in our case
  . compression spring
   . G = 29.3
   . d = 0.3
   . D = 8.2
   . Na = 10
   . k = 17.6
  . extraction spring
   . G = 29.3
   . d = 0.7
   . D = 6
   . Na = 19
   . k =

  . this one allows for an axe to block the arm. holes are made in a set of
  precomputed angles, allowing to choose the angle at which the arm will stop
